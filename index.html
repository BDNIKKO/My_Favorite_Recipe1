        <h1>Pizza</h1>
        <p>
            Pizza is my favorite food because of its <b>versatility</b> and <b>flavor</b>.
            It can be made with a variety of toppings, sauces, and crusts, catering to diverse tastes and preferences. <br><br>
            The combination of a crispy crust, savory sauce, melted cheese, and various toppings creates a flavor profile that is universally appealing.
